# Code-Refactor
- All div and span tags removed to preserve HTML semantics.
- As a result CSS was changed to align with the improved HTML tags.
- Simplified redundant HTML for cleaner code without altering functionality.
- Header and h1 tags placed within the body for appropriate labeling.
- Nav and section tags were added to preserve HTML semantics. However, the original ID was kept to preserve some of the CSS structure.
- Div tags held within the section tag were switched to main tags.
- Article tags added for appropriate labeling.
- Redundant CSS files were scrapped due to the inclusion of appropriate HTML semantics.
